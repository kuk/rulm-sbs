Over time, the combination phrase was simplified and absorbed into the English language as the modern word for \"oblique\".\n\nIn ancient times, the word \"oblique\" was often used to describe a certain type of angle, which is still its primary meaning today. The word is often used in trigonometry, geometry, and mathematics in reference to angles. The word is also commonly used to refer to anything that is not straight or direct, and is instead angled, skewed or curved.

Go to repository > \"Pull Requests\" tab > and you can see the files/commits that have conflict.\n\n2. Next, clone the repository to your local machine. \n\n3. Then, check out the branch that has the conflict. \n\n4. After that, merge the branch with the conflicting files into your current branch.\n\n5. Now open up the files that have conflicts in your favorite text editor. You will see a section which has conflicting changes from branches. \n\n6. Decide which changes should remain in the file and delete other changes that are redundant. \n\n7. Add the line \"<<<<<<< HEAD\" and \">>>>>>> branch_name\" up and down of conflicting changes you want to remain in the file. This line helps isolate the selected changes and delete other unnecessary changes.\n\n8. Finally, add and push your changes to GitHub, and your merge conflict is resolved."}

{"id": "user_oriented_task_89", "prompt": "Instruction: Answer the following question.\nInput: How do I compare strings in Java?\nI've been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far. However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.\nIs == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?\n\nOutput: ", "output": "\nUsing the == operator to compare strings in Java can lead to unexpected behavior.
