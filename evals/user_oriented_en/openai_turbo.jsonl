Examples of oblique architecture can be seen in buildings such as Le Corbusier's Unit√© d'Habitation in Marseille, France. \n\nToday, the word \"oblique\" is still commonly used in both its geometric and figurative meanings.

Identify the conflict: Whenever you face a merge conflict in GitHub, you need to identify it first. A conflict happens when there are conflicting changes in the same file, and Git doesn't know which changes to accept.\n\n2. Pull the latest code: Before trying to resolve a conflict, you should ensure that you have the latest version of the code. Run the `git pull` command to retrieve the latest changes from the repository.\n\n3. Locate the conflicted file(s): Git will show you which files have conflicts in them. You can view the files using the terminal or through your code editor.\n\n4. Open the conflicted file(s): Once you have located the conflicted file, open it in your preferred code editor. You'll see two sets of code that are conflicting.\n\n5. Analyze the conflicts: Analyze the changes that caused the conflict, and decide how you want to resolve them.\n\n6. Resolve the conflicts: In your editor, remove the parts of the code that you don't want to keep until all conflicts are removed. Make sure the final code is working correctly.\n\n7. Add and commit the changes: Add the changes you have made to the conflicted files using the `git add` command. Then, commit your changes using the `git commit` command.\n\n8. Push the changes: Finally, push the resolved changes to the repository using the `git push` command.\n\n9. Double-check everything: After pushing the changes, double-check everything to be sure that everything is working correctly.\n\n10.

What's the difference?\n\nOutput: ", "output": "In Java, to compare strings, it is recommended to use the .equals() method rather than the == operator. The reason for this is that the == operator only checks if the objects being compared have the same memory address, while the .equals() method checks if the contents of the strings are the same. As a result, using == to compare strings may lead to unexpected results.

The idea is to find whether the given number n is a power of three or not. If n is a power of three, then there must exist an integer x such that n = 3^x. We can use logarithm to find the value of x. If the value of x is an integer, then n is a power of three, otherwise it is not.\n\nTo find the logarithm of n to the base 3, we can use the formula log(n) / log(3). If the value of x is an integer, then the value of log(n) / log(3) must also be an integer.\n\nThus, the solution involves the following steps:\n1. Check if n is less than or equal to 0. If yes, return false.\n2. Find the value of log(n) / log(3).\n3. Check if the integer part of the value of log(n) / log(3) is equal to the value of log(n) / log(3).
